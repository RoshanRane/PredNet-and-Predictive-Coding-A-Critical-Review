## Problem:
Future frame prediction in videos is a promising avenue for unsupervised video representation learning. Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video.

## Solution: 
Our goal in this project is to use various Deep-Learning/ Generative architecures to predict the future frames for a given real-time video. Also, in this project we tried to used the annotated text to evaluate whether it helps to explain the generation of correct future frames or not.
